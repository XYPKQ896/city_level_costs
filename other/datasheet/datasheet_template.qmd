abstract: "AidData has partnered with the Municipal Finance and Urban Economy branch of UN-Habitat, the UN’s agency for human settlement, to conduct a pilot study of the new methodology in cities across five countries—Bolivia, Colombia, India, Malaysia, and Sweden—that are representative of developed and developing contexts. In this report, we outline our reproducible methodology to systematically quantify the costs for cities of achieving SDG 11 across five thematic areas—housing, transportation, waste management, public spaces, and governance—and provide country briefs with our methodology's results for each country. This dataset contains the data used in our Counting the Costs methodology. In the next phase of our work, we hope to refine and scale the methodology to include other thematic areas and develop decision support tools that help cities maximize their resource allocation."

**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - This dataset contains city data for five countries—Bolivia, Colombia, India, Malaysia, and Sweden—used in our Counting the Costs report to quantify the city-level costs for urban areas to achieve SDG11.
2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The dataset was created by the AidData research lab, which operates as part of the College of William & Mary.
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - The dataset was funded by AidData’s institutional resources. The names are Prakash, M., Kamiya, M., Cheng, M., & S. Schaedel.
4. *Any other comments?*
    - NA

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- Each instance in the dataset represents a city in a developing country. Data points include economic indicators, measures of conflict, population, and infrastructure characteristics.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- The dataset includes 151 cities.
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is a sample focused on cities from developing countries, with coverage determined by data availability. It is not exhaustive but aims to capture a diverse range of urban environments.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance contains city-level metrics such as households, income, rent, and population density. The data has been processed to provide meaningful indicators.
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- NA
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Some cities have incomplete data due to limitations in available sources, such as Current Length of Roads or Paved roads (% total).
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- No explicit relationships are defined between cities; however, spatial patterns or correlations could be inferred using geolocation data.
8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- NA
9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- NA
10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- Yes.
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No. The dataset consists of publicly available information.
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- No. The data is neutral and focused on quantitative analysis.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- No.
14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- No, the dataset does not include individual-level data
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No, the data is aggregated at the city level and does not include sensitive individual information.
16. *Any other comments?*
	- NA

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
	- Data was gathered from multiple public sources, including national economic statistics.
2. *What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (for example, hardware apparatuses or sensors, manual human curation, software programs, software APIs)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*
	- A combination of manual data curation and automated extraction techniques from trusted repositories and datasets.
3. *If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (for example, deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?*
	- The dataset includes cities with available data on conflict and economic indicators, focusing on developing countries.
